# Portal Brick Break
A wonky, incomplete, and somehwat buggy brick clone in C++/SFML for Linux and probably macOS and Windows, too.

Move with a/d or left/right arrows, move portals with left/right click, start the game with space and exit with esc (or just lose).

Taking inspiration from the first ~10min of a Youtube video on the subject, I thought I'd spend an evening building a brick break clone. I'm not sure if it's me, game development in general, or the small scope of the project that lent itself to kinda spaghettifying the code, but I really didn't enjoy it so here it is in its working-but-unfinished glory.

I did like the SFML library, though.
